DESCRIPTION
    Modern references include:
      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_auto-config

    This version allows use of a .pac file on disk as well as on the 
    network, and improves the JavaScript to perl translation process,
    almost to the point of being usable.
     
    Any fancy JavaScript in the .pac or wpad.dat file is can still  
    result in a perl syntax error, but hopefully it will be displayed 
    in an understandable way.  

    If this happens to you, complain to craig@animalhead.com.  Include 
    the error message and the .pac or wpad.dat file.

    This module is being developed to provide access for Perl scripts 
    to the Proxy Auto Config format from Netscape, originally at:
    http://home.netscape.com/eng/mozilla/2.0/relnotes/demo/proxy-live.html

    The URL above is no longer valid.  The file is now archived at
    http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Web/autoproxy.html
     
    This is very very alpha, and may end up being sucked into another 
    package if I can find a different maintainer.
